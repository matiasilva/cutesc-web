# cutesc-web

This is the home of the CU Technical Societies Coalition's website, powered by Sheets and Hugo.

The website uses Google Sheets as the data layer (for some abuse of the term "headless CMS") and Hugo, the static site generator written in Go, to combine this data with pretty styles to make a static, super quick-to-load website.

It is hosted on the [SRCF](https://www.srcf.net).
